## AI Task: Complete README Transformation

Hello Cursor AI! Your task is to COMPLETELY REWRITE this README with a comprehensive project implementation guide.

### Critical Requirements:

1. **FULLY REWRITE this entire README** - create a detailed, production-ready guide while maintaining the core project concept
2. **Create a DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP PLAN (max 8 steps)** that covers:
   - Environment setup with all required technologies
   - Project structure creation
   - Implementation of core features
   - Testing and deployment approaches
3. **Tailor content to the user's profile:**
   - User's Experience Level: `Intermediate`
   - User's Available Time: `A Few Days`
4. **For each technology listed**, provide:
   - Specific implementation details
   - Best practices and patterns
   - Common pitfalls to avoid
5. **Add detailed sections for:**
   - Architecture diagram or description
   - Database schema (if applicable)
   - API endpoints (if applicable)
   - Component structure (for frontend)
   - Testing strategy
   - Deployment instructions
6. **Provide code examples** for critical project parts
7. **REMOVE THESE INSTRUCTIONS COMPLETELY** after your rewrite

Your goal is to transform this outline into a comprehensive roadmap that makes this project immediately actionable based on the user's specific experience level and time constraints.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL FIRST STEP ‚ö†Ô∏è

**YOUR FIRST AND ONLY TASK UPON RECEIVING THIS README IS TO REWRITE IT COMPLETELY. DO NOT START IMPLEMENTING THE PROJECT OR WRITING ANY CODE YET.**

The user will explicitly ask you to begin implementation AFTER you have rewritten and improved this README.

# Mental Health Buddy

## Project Overview
Create a web application that connects users with mental health professionals and provides resources for mental wellness. The app will allow users to create profiles, search for therapists, schedule sessions, and access relevant articles and videos.


> **üí° Quick Start:** After cloning this repository and opening it in Cursor, simply tell the AI: "Read the README and guide me through implementing this project step by step." Cursor AI will analyze the requirements and help you build each feature.


## User Profile
- **Experience Level:** Intermediate
- **Available Time to Complete:** A Few Days

## Technologies
- **React**: Used for building the frontend of the application, creating user interfaces, and handling user interactions.
- **Node.js**: Used for building the backend of the application, creating API endpoints, and handling server-side logic.
- **Express**: Used for building the RESTful API and handling HTTP requests.
- **MongoDB**: Used for storing user data, therapist profiles, and session schedules.
- **Redux**: Used for managing global state and handling application-wide data flow.
- ** CSS**: Used for styling and layout of the application.


## Development Steps
### 1. Set up the project structure
Create a new React app using create-react-app, set up the Node.js backend, and configure the Express server.

### 2. Design the database schema
Define the MongoDB schema for storing user data, therapist profiles, and session schedules.

### 3. Implement user authentication
Use Node.js and Express to implement user authentication and authorization.

### 4. Create therapist profiles and search functionality
Use React and Redux to create therapist profiles and implement search functionality.

### 5. Implement session scheduling
Use Node.js and Express to implement session scheduling and send reminders to users.

### 6. Integrate with payment gateway
Use a payment gateway API to handle payment processing for therapy sessions.

### 7. Add mental health resources
Use React to create a page with mental health resources, including articles and videos.

### 8. Test and deploy the application
Test the application thoroughly and deploy it to a cloud platform like Heroku or AWS.


## Main Features
Features will be added soon


## Sample Code
```javascript
// Example code snippet for user authentication
app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
  const { username, password } = req.body;
  // Authenticate user and return token
}
```


## Getting Started
Instructions will be added soon

## AI Coding Prompts

Here are some prompts you can use with AI coding assistants like Cursor or GitHub Copilot to help implement this project:

### Prompt 1
```
Implement user authentication for the Mental Health Buddy app by creating a login endpoint in Node.js using Express.js. Generate a starter code structure for the endpoint, including error handling and a basic authentication mechanism. Use the provided code snippet as a starting point. Start coding!
```

### Prompt 2
```
Build the core functionality of user authentication in the Mental Health Buddy app by implementing user registration, password hashing, and session management using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. Ensure secure password storage and implement a basic validation mechanism. Continue coding!
```

### Prompt 3
```
Enhance the user authentication functionality in the Mental Health Buddy app by implementing two-factor authentication (2FA) using a third-party library and integrating it with the existing authentication mechanism. Use Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB to store and verify 2FA tokens. Add advanced security features to your app!
```


Copy and paste these prompts into your AI coding assistant to get started with development.
